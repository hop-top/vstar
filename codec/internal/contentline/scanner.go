// Package contentline implements the shared RFC 5545 §3.1 content-line
// unfolding scanner used by both the iCalendar (rfc5545) and vCard
// (rfc6350) codecs. RFC 6350 §3.2 references RFC 5545 §3.1 for line
// folding, so the two formats need byte-identical scanning behavior.
//
// The package lives under codec/internal so it is reachable from both
// rfc5545 and rfc6350 (and the streaming codec) but never escapes the
// codec subtree as a public API. Callers outside the V* codec packages
// MUST consume content lines via the public rfc5545.Scanner re-export.
//
// Design notes:
//   - Streaming shape (one logical line at a time) keeps the streaming
//     codec constant-memory; the eager rfc6350 unfold path wraps Next
//     in a small helper rather than the other way around.
//   - Lenient blank-then-WSP handling: when a WSP-prefixed line appears
//     with no pending logical line in flight (e.g. after a blank line
//     that broke a fold sequence in malformed input), the leading WSP
//     is stripped and a fresh logical line starts. This mirrors the
//     pre-consolidation rfc6350 behavior and fixes a stray-leading-space
//     bug that the pre-consolidation rfc5545 scanner exhibited.
//   - Both CRLF (RFC-correct) and bare LF (lenient) are accepted as
//     physical-line terminators. Trailing partial lines (no final
//     terminator) are surfaced as a final logical line before EOF.

// Scanner reads a stream of content lines from an io.Reader, performing
// line unfolding per RFC 5545 §3.1. The wire format permits a logical
// content line to be split across multiple physical lines by inserting
// CRLF + (SP | HTAB); on read, those sequences are replaced with
// nothing (the SP/HTAB and the CRLF are both consumed) and the
// continuation is appended to the previous logical line.
//
// Scanner accepts CRLF or LF as physical-line terminators (be liberal
// on input). It silently skips blank physical lines that do not appear
// inside a fold sequence; a WSP-prefixed line that follows a blank
// (and therefore has no pending line to extend) is treated as a fresh
// logical line with its leading WSP byte stripped, mirroring vCard
// real-world parser leniency.
//
// The zero value is not usable — construct with NewScanner. Scanner is
// not safe for concurrent use; callers wanting to scan multiple inputs
// should construct one Scanner per Reader.
