// Package diff provides semantic equality and structural diff for V*
// values. "Semantic" means via canonical form: two values that yield
// identical canonical bytes are reported equal regardless of property
// order, parameter order, datetime form, or whitespace. Diff returns
// property-level structural changes suitable for human display or
// programmatic inspection.
//
// Public API (mirroring the canonical package's per-type pattern,
// with `Of`-prefixed diff entrypoints to dodge the function/type
// name collision Go disallows — see OfComponent's doc):
//
//   - Component(a, b vstar.Component) bool — semantic Equal.
//   - Card(a, b vstar.Card) bool          — semantic Equal.
//   - Calendar(a, b vstar.Calendar) bool  — semantic Equal.
//   - OfComponent(a, b vstar.Component) ComponentDiff
//   - OfCard(a, b vstar.Card) ComponentDiff
//   - OfCalendar(a, b vstar.Calendar) []ComponentDiff
//   - (ComponentDiff).String() string for unified-diff-ish rendering.
//
// Equality rules (delegated to canonical):
//
//   - X-VSTAR-HASH is excluded from comparison and from diff output
//     on both sides (mirrors canonical's spec/03 rule 7 exclusion).
//   - Property/parameter ordering is irrelevant.
//   - Datetime forms compare equal when canonical resolves them to
//     the same UTC representation (TZID-tagged ↔ Z-suffixed where
//     a matching VTIMEZONE is in scope).
//
// Diff matching heuristics (documented limitations for v0.1):
//
//   - Sub-components are paired by (Type, UID) when both carry a
//     UID. Sub-components without a UID (e.g. VALARM) are paired
//     positionally by index in Sub. Reordering UID-less Subs will
//     therefore surface as Added+Removed rather than Changed.
//   - PropertyDiff entries within ComponentDiff.Properties are
//     emitted sorted by Property.Name (alphabetical, case-
//     insensitive). This matches canonical's property ordering rule
//     in practice but is specified independently for the diff layer.
//
// Performance: v0.1 prioritizes correctness. Equal currently routes
// through a full canonical-byte comparison; per-property short-
// circuiting is out of scope.
